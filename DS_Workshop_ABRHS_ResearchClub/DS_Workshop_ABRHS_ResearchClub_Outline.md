# ABRHS Research Club Data Science Workshop 2023    
  
  
### Workshop Title:  
Introduction to Machine Learning  
  
  
### Workshop Objective:  
Participants will learn the fundamentals of classical machine learning analysis, including data preprocessing and feature engineering, ML model training, and how to 
evaluate the performance of their models.  
   
### Workshop Outline:  

#### Part 0: Python basics

- How to start coding in Python programming language.   


#### Part 1: Data Preprocessing

- Introduction to data cleaning and its importance in the machine learning process.  
- Common data cleaning techniques like handling missing values, dealing with outliers, feature engineering (data normalization).  
- Data summarization and statistics. Basic graphics.
- Live demonstration of data preprocessing using Python Pandas library.  

#### Part 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

- Introduction to Machine Learning.
- Classification and regression
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning


#### Part 3: Classical Machine Learning algorithms: SVM, KNN

- Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm
- Overview of the hyperparameters used in SVM and KNN: kernel type, number of neighbors and distance metrics, etc.
- Live demonstration of ML classification using Python and Scikit-learn library.



#### Part 4: Model Evaluation

- Explanation of how to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
- Overview of the different metrics such as sensitivity and specificity, ROC curve
- Live demonstration of model evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn library.
  
  
#### Part 5: Q&A session


#### Prerequisites for Participants:

Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
Familiarity with basic concepts of statistics and linear algebra.
Experience in working with data in a tabular form.  

#### Materials Required:

- Use your google account to use  https://colab.research.google.com/ to work in a notebook, or have a computer with Python and the required libraries pre-installed (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, etc.).  
- Workshop slides and handouts.  
- Sample dataset for practice.
