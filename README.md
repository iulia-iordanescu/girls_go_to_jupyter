Step 2) Clicking on the “sign up” option should take you to the below screen where you can choose your username. Make sure to input a secure password and to link your email in the space provided! Once you
have done so, click “create account”.

Step 3) Next, customize your profile! Enter a display name, a fun description about yourself and a profile picture. All are optional; you can skip this step. Once you are happy with your profile, click “looks good!”

Step 8) Now that we have finished customizing our profile, it’s time to understand how repl works. Let’s do this by making our very first repl. Click the “+ create” button in the upper left menu or the “+” sign beneath the “Create” header.

Now, let’s get to coding. Ready for your first instructions?! Type “print(“Hello World!”)” into your repl and click the green “Run” button.

Step 11) Look at that! You have executed your first line of code.
